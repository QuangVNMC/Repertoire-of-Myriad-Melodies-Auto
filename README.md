# Repertoire of Myriad Melodies Auto
Ultra WIP Repertoire of Myriad Melodies Auto Play  
Because im bad at python, most of the code is generated by ChatGPT üêß  
Hope someone see this, forks it and make a proper version  
Currently only the image recognition part kinda work (This use ResNet18), maybe i will get it working properly with auto click  
If someone really want to fix this then you will need Python 3.12 and this command : pip install torch torchvision pillow opencv-python numpy pyautogui pygetwindow matplotlib
